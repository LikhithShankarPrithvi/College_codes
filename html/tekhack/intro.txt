PROBLEM STATEMENT: IMPLEMENTING A STARTUP IDEA WITH ONLY A SEED OF IDEA/ WITH ONLY PRODUCT MAKING SKILLS /WITH ONLY INVESTMENT /WITH ONLY ENTREPRENEURSHIP SKILLS IS INAPPROPRIATE AND DIFFICULT.

OUR SOLUTION/ IDEA: WE DEVELOP An AI INTERFACE WHICH INTEGRATES A TEAM WITH SUITABLE SKILLS, FOR PEOPLE HAVING ASPIRING IDEAS TO IMPLEMENT A STARTUP.
TEAMING UP A GROUP OF PEOPLE IS IMPLEMENTED BY STUDYING THE DATA PROVIDED BY EACH PERSON AND USING THE PERSON'S SKILL RATING 
WE WILL GROUP A TEAM BASED ON PEOPLE HAVING A SIMILAR PERSPECTIVE TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT WITH SAME SKILL & DIFFERENT SUITABLE SKILLS.
THE AI SYSTEM RUNS DIAGNOSIS ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PERSON SEEKING A TEAM AND FINDS SUITABLE PEOPLE WITH SUITABLE SKILLS USING THE BIG DATA PROVIDED BY THE PERSON'S SKILL RATING IN THE REQUIRED ASPECTS A,EASE OF ACCESS TO THE PERSON BASED ON LOCALITY AND COMMUNICATION VERSATALITY.

Skill log WILL ENHANCE A PLATFORM SUCH THAT A SEED OF IDEA IS GROWN INTO A PLANT.
